# Logo-Generator

SVG logo generator using Object Oriented Programming

## Description

This application was created to 1. create a simple system for making a logo and 2. display my capabilities in regard to Object Oriented Programming. This application uses the npm inquirer package for requesting user input and jest for testing the existing code for errors.

## Installation

This project is only accessible via your CLI. To access, please clone the repository, direct yourself to the location that the repository is housed, and then run 'node index.js' to use. To view your newly generated logo, open the index.html file in your default browser/live server.


## Usage

When using the application, you should see something similar to the screenshot below. The screenshot shows the questions that the program will ask the user, as well as example answers that are suitable for generating the SVG logo. If you're not seeing something similar when you use the application, please email me at TinaTheDev91@gmail.com.
